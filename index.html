            <h1>Hey! I'm Ethan Rutt, a developer based out of Austin, TX.</h1>
            <p>
                I am a Senior Computer Science student at Texas A&M
                University. The areas that I enjoy working in are low level
                and embedded systems. I also enjoy full stack development,
                both working on optimizing backend operations and creating
                beautiful web pages that are user friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the industry, I have been doing the martial art Judo
                since I was around 5 years old, and am currently the VP of
                the Texas A&M Judo Club as well as a black belt. I am also
                currently studing Japanese.
            </p>
