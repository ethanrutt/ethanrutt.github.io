                            Software Validation Engineer : May - August 2024
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Renesas Electronics is a semiconductor company. I worked in
                            the Austin branch that makes voltage regulator chips.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This summer, I began by working with the Validation
                            Team's test database. I wanted to create a nice report
                            that concisely gave the current progress so that these
                            could be shown to managers and executives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After completing this, I then took a step into the
                            hardware world, where I rewrote an existing test. The
                            test involved throttling the enable pin of one of our
                            microcontrollers to make sure that it still behaved as
                            intended. This required learning about things that a
                            software engineer wouldn't normally learn about, so it
                            was very fun to take a deep dive into the hardware
                            world. I ended up successfully rewriting the test and
                            finding an existing firmware bug in a chip that was
                            already in production.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Renesas Electronics is a semiconductor company. I worked in
                            the Austin branch that makes voltage regulator chips.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This summer, I worked on an ambitious project called the
                            Factor Engine. The background of this project was that
                            the people who design the chips had a very annoying and
                            difficult workflow. It involved designing in verilog,
                            then defining their tests in these peculiar csv files
                            with c preprocessor notation in the cells. These were
                            then run through a scala parser and output tests that
                            they could use. This was a very bad workflow. On top of
                            this, the validation and GUI teams also would like to
                            use these tests and configurations, but they couldn't
                            because of a difference of technologies. The Factor
                            Engine wanted to fix that by unifying the chip
                            configuration into one structure, able to model a chip
                            in memory for use in the GUI, the Validation tools, and
                            the Design simulation tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This involved recreating the chip definitions in c++,
                            creating c bindings for them, then outputting Java and
                            Python bindings through ctypes and jna. I was able to
                            work on this and made great strides in modeling the
                            registers and getting the windows builds set up. I
                            learned so much about software engineering, version
                            control, the interactions between c and c++, and much
                            more.

                            Vector Marketing is a direct sales company that sells Cutco
                            Knives. I founded my own sales office based out of
                            Bastrop, TX.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This summer, I founded my own sales office, recruited,
                            interviewed, trained, and developed a team of 25+ Cutco
                            Sales Representatives to sell over $30k worth of
                            kitchen knives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was something that isn't like my character. I was
                            never a super outgoing person, so the fact that I could
                            do this really proved to myself that I can do whatever
                            I set my mind to. At the beginning of the summer I had
                            many hard weeks where I had no money coming in, but
                            once I got off the ground in mid June, I never looked
                            back. The bulk of the $30k that I sold was in late July
                            and August, because at that point my team had so much
                            momentum. I learned many lessons throughout this summer
                            and I believe my soft skills developed so much for
                            having done this.

                        <p>
                            Vector Marketing is a direct sales company that sells Cutco
                            Knives. I founded my own sales office based out of
                            Bastrop, TX.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This summer and throughout my first year of college, I was
                            working and selling kitchen knives. I joined in June
                            and sold $10k within the first week of being on the
                            job. I then continued throughout the rest of the summer
                            to sell around $30k personally by networking, setting
                            appointments, and doing in person demonstrations with
                            potential clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was then accepted into the fair and show events team,
                            where I was able to seek out small events such as
                            farmers markets and market days, where I set up a booth
                            and sold for the duration of the event. This required
                            scheduling, talking to event promoters, setting up
                            booths, and handling other admin tasks that were
                            required to be on the events team. I did all of this
                            while taking classes at Texas A&M.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On top of the events team, I was also accepted into the
                            manager in training program, where I learned different
                            management skills and prepared to open my own sales
                            office for a summer (see Vector Marketing 2). This
                            involved weekly meetings, running interviews, and more
                            while also taking classes at Texas A&M.
