    <h1 style="padding-top: 80px;">FZF Git is Amazing</h1>

    <p>Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve heard of <code>git</code>. Iâ€™m not as sure, but still
        pretty sure youâ€™ve heard of <code>fzf</code>. If you havenâ€™t heard of
        <code>fzf</code> then close this tab and go back to whatever you were
        doing before. Maybe look up <code>fzf</code>. Maybe install it and play
        around with it. But this information is not for you until your eyes have
        been opened.
    </p>
    <p>If you have heard of <code>fzf</code>, have you heard of
        <code>fzf-git</code>? Maybe <code>fzf.vim</code> or
        <code>fzf-lua</code>? These are all awesome integrations that make stuff
        easier. I honestly donâ€™t know how I did anything before I had these
        tools.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-does-this-fix">What Does This Fix?</h3>
    <p>Have you ever typed out something extremely long (ðŸ˜‰) in the terminal
        like a commit hash, filename, branch, hit enter, and then was off by one
        character? Maybe you are a little smarter about it and use tab
        autocomplete or copy paste from your browser? There is still a better
        and faster way to do this.</p>
    <p>In a keyboard focused workflow, we want to avoid going to the browser
        to copy and paste stuff like commit hashes or branches. If we have to go
        to the browser to copy two different commit hashes or branches, then we
        have already wasted so much time.</p>
    <p>Instead of that, we can use <code>fzf-git</code>.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m not going to go through the installation and keybinds, all that
        is available in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-git.sh">repository</a>. I am going
        to go through some practical examples of how I use this tool in my
        day-to-day git operations to go <em>blazingly fast</em></p>
    <h3 id="branches">Branches</h3>
    <p>Say your coworker creates a new branch called <code>asdf</code>, and
        you want to check this branch out. This will not be on your branch list
        since itâ€™s not checked out to your system yet, and to explicitly define
        it, you will have to get the branch from remote. This could be something
        like copy pasting it or checking your remotes and copying it from there.
        You will often have to write out <code>origin/branchname</code> or
        something similar.</p>
    <p>With <code>fzf-git</code>, I can do this much easier.</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
        <pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"
                        tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> switch <span class="at">-t</span> <span
                        class="op">&lt;</span>C-g<span class="op">&gt;&lt;</span>C-b<span
                        class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
    </div>
    <img class="blog-img" src="/images/fzf_git_is_amazing_branches.png">
    <p>This pulls up the <code>Branches</code> picker. I can then press
        <code>&lt;M-a&gt;</code> to show all branches, including branches from
        remote, fuzzy find to my branch, and then hit enter to select it. Now it
        is pasted right in the command. In larger projects we often have a
        naming convention for branches, so they can get rather long and might
        have some boiler plate like a ticket name before the actual branch name,
        i.e.Â <code>ASDF123-actual-branch-name</code>. Having to type that out is
        a pain, and going to the browser to copy it can also be a pain. I can
        instead just fuzzy find starting with <code>actual-branch-name</code>
        and <code>fzf</code> will find it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="commit-hashes">Commit Hashes</h3>
    <p>This is by far the most useful feature, diffing between commits,
        cherry picking commits, looking at diffs for various commits, and a ton
        more are made super easy with this. You can fuzzy find by commit
        message, and the hash is output with this command, so instead of
        tracking down commit hashes and copy pasting them to the diff command,
        you can just do</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2">
        <pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"
                        tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> diff <span class="op">&lt;</span>C-g<span
                        class="op">&gt;&lt;</span>C-h<span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span>C-g<span
                        class="op">&gt;&lt;</span>C-h<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
    </div>
    <img class="blog-img" src="/images/fzf_git_is_amazing_hashes.png">
    <p>and search through your hashes by the actual hash itself. I also find
        this handier than <code>git log</code> since I can see additional
        information like what was in the commit in the preview window. I find
        myself just going <code>&lt;C-g&gt;&lt;C-h&gt;</code> instead of typing
        <code>git log</code> or <code>git log --oneline</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="files">Files</h3>
    <p>Working with files is already a pain, and if you are still using tab
        autocomplete for deeply nested files, this is the time to stop. If you
        have the <code>fzf</code> keybinds set up, you know that you can do
        <code>&lt;C-t&gt;</code> to pull up a file fuzzy finder. This is nice,
        but we can take it one step further with
        <code>&lt;C-g&gt;&lt;C-f&gt;</code>. This adds nice things like
        previews, <code>git status</code> notifications on the left side, and
        the ability to open the file in your browser or open it in your editor,
        and see a preview (with syntax highlighting if you are using
        <code>bat</code>).
    </p>
    <p>If you are prototyping, often you will make changes to a file that
        you donâ€™t want to commit, and after you confirm your proof of concept,
        you will want to <code>git restore</code> those files. Or if you
        accidentally <code>git add</code> something, you want to
        <code>git restore --staged</code> it. You might have other changes that
        you want to keep, so to specify that exact file can be cumbersome.
        Instead, you can do
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3">
        <pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"
                        tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> restore <span class="op">&lt;</span>C-g<span
                        class="op">&gt;&lt;</span>C-f<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
    </div>
    <img class="blog-img" src="/images/fzf_git_is_amazing_files.png">
    <p>and easily find the modified or untracked files, along with a preview
        to make sure that you are restoring the right ones.</p>
    <p>A bonus tip is you can select multiple files with <code>Tab</code> or
        <code>Shift-Tab</code> in the <code>fzf</code> window, so you donâ€™t have
        to press <code>&lt;C-g&gt;&lt;C-f&gt;</code> multiple times if you want
        multiple files.
    </p>
    <p>This also works for <code>git add</code> of course.</p>
    <h3 id="combining-it-all-with-checkout">Combining It All With
        Checkout</h3>
    <p>If you want to grab a file from a different branches or different
        commit and pull that into your branch, this would be a massive pain to
        do manually.</p>
    <p>With <code>fzf-git</code>, you can do this very easily</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb4">
        <pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"
                        tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> checkout <span class="op">&lt;</span>C-g<span
                        class="op">&gt;&lt;</span>C-b<span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span>C-g<span
                        class="op">&gt;&lt;</span>C-f<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>I think you get the idea. There are also bindings for tags, remotes,
        stashes, reflogs, worktrees, and <code>for-each-ref</code></p>
