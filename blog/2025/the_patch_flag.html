    <h1 style="padding-top: 80px;">The Patch Flag</h1>
    <p>In <code>git</code>, there is a flag that I rarely see people use,
        but it‚Äôs super helpful and exists on a lot of <code>git</code>
        commands.</p>
    <p>This flag is the <code>--patch</code> or <code>-p</code> flag. What
        does it do? Well it patches of course. Can‚Äôt you read? Have you ever
        opened up a page of documentation in your life? You have? Oh ok, sorry
        for being so aggressive.</p>
    <p>I find this to be the main way that I add changes to my working tree
        now. It allows you to go hunk by hunk and decide what to do with your
        changes.</p>
    <p>What‚Äôs a hunk? The person reading this. üòâ.</p>
    <p>No, a hunk is a chunk of code that has changes in it.</p>
    <img src="/images/patch_flag_hunk.png">
    <p>See those little <code>+</code> signs in the gutter? Those would be
        hunks.</p>
    <p><code>git add -p</code> adds your changes as they come up in
        hunks.</p>
    <img src="/images/patch_flag_add.png">
    <p>What are all those letters? Well, you could press <code>?</code> and
        it would tell you but I guess I‚Äôll type it out here for you. A ‚Äúthank
        you‚Äù would be nice.</p>
    <pre><code>y - stage this hunk
            n - do not stage this hunk
            q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones
            a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
            d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
            s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks
            e - manually edit the current hunk
            p - print the current hunk, &#39;P&#39; to use the pager
            ? - print help</code></pre>
    <p>Pretty nice huh. I‚Äôll let you figure the rest out yourself.</p>
    <p>You can also use this with - <code>git checkout -p</code> - This does
        the same thing. Instead of just checking out entire files from another
        branch or commit and clobbering your working tree changes, you can do
        this. If there‚Äôs a specific change you want in the file, this is super
        useful. - <code>git restore -p</code> - Have you ever wanted to
        partially restore some hunks in a file? - <code>git stash -p</code> -
        You can pull only certain changes from your stash -
        <code>git reset -p</code> - But I normally use <code>git restore</code>
        anyway - <code>git commit -p</code> - This has a patch flag as well
    </p>
